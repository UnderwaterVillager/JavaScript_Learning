#   OBJECTS
-   Objects are set of properties of different types allowed, supporting getters and setter(OOP encapsulation pratice).
-   They map strings to values.
-   Properties can be deleted and added, but can represent static objects.
-   They support inheritance, by prototypes.
-   I can change values from reference, rather than by value, THAT MEANS IF X POINTS TO Y, AND I CHANGE X, Y IS CHANGED AS WELL.

##  CREATING OBJECTS
-   Can be created by literals(attribution of data, something = {}), creating numerous object if inside a loop or function.
-   By built-in
 constructor
## DESTRUCTURING OBJECTS
